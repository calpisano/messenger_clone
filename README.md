## My Messenger Clone project

Hi, I'm Chris and I am currently building a lite messenger web app. I am using React and Next.JS, for the front-end framework, and I am using NodeJS to simulate communication with a server. I haven't uploaded the code for the NodsJS server to GitHub but I will do so soon!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm intstall
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
